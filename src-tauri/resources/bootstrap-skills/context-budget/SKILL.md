# Context Budget

Analyze token overhead across components actually loaded into a Visionox session and surface evidence-based optimizations.

## When to Use

- Session performance feels sluggish or output quality is degrading
- You've recently added many skills, agents, or MCP servers
- You want to know how much context headroom you actually have
- Planning to add more components and need to know if there's room
- Running `/context-budget` command (this skill backs it)

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Inventory

Scan all component directories and estimate token consumption:

**Agent/subagent definitions** (only when exposed by the active harness)
- Count definitions that are actually injected into the session
- Do not assume an `agents/` directory is loaded merely because it exists

**Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`)
- Count tokens per SKILL.md
- Flag: files >400 lines
- Check for duplicate copies in `.agents/skills/` — skip identical copies to avoid double-counting

**Rules** (`rules/**/*.md`)
- Count tokens per file
- Flag: files >100 lines
- Detect content overlap between rule files in the same language module

**MCP Servers** (`.mcp.json` or active MCP config)
- Count configured servers and total tool count
- Estimate schema overhead at ~500 tokens per tool
- Flag: servers with >20 tools, servers that wrap simple CLI commands (`gh`, `git`, `npm`, `supabase`, `vercel`)

**Project memory** (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and other files reported by the runtime)
- Count tokens per file in the loaded project-memory chain
- Flag: combined total >300 lines

### Phase 2: Classify

Sort every component into a bucket:

| Bucket | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Always needed** | Referenced in project memory, backs an active command, or matches current project type | Keep |
| **Sometimes needed** | Domain-specific (e.g. language patterns), not referenced in project memory | Consider on-demand activation |
| **Rarely needed** | No command reference, overlapping content, or no obvious project match | Remove or lazy-load |

### Phase 3: Detect Issues

Identify the following problem patterns:

- **Bloated agent descriptions** — only when evidence shows descriptions are injected into every request or delegation
- **Heavy agent definitions** — only when evidence shows full definitions are loaded rather than on demand
- **Redundant components** — skills that duplicate agent logic, rules that duplicate project memory
- **MCP over-subscription** — >10 servers, or servers wrapping CLI tools available for free
- **Project-memory bloat** — verbose explanations, outdated sections, or duplicated instructions

### Phase 4: Report

Produce the context budget report:

```
Context Budget Report
═══════════════════════════════════════

Total estimated overhead: ~XX,XXX tokens
Context model: [active model and configured limit, or "not reported"]
Effective available context: ~XXX,XXX tokens (XX%)

Component Breakdown:
┌─────────────────┬────────┬───────────┐
│ Component       │ Count  │ Tokens    │
├─────────────────┼────────┼───────────┤
│ Agents          │ N      │ ~X,XXX    │
│ Skills          │ N      │ ~X,XXX    │
│ Rules           │ N      │ ~X,XXX    │
│ MCP tools       │ N      │ ~XX,XXX   │
│ Project memory  │ N      │ ~X,XXX    │
└─────────────────┴────────┴───────────┘

WARNING: Issues Found (N):
[ranked by token savings]

Top 3 Optimizations:
1. [action] → save ~X,XXX tokens
2. [action] → save ~X,XXX tokens
3. [action] → save ~X,XXX tokens

Potential savings: ~XX,XXX tokens (XX% of current overhead)
```

In verbose mode, additionally output per-file token counts, line-by-line breakdown of the heaviest files, specific redundant lines between overlapping components, and MCP tool list with per-tool schema size estimates.

## Examples

**Basic audit**
```
User: /context-budget
Skill: Scans the active setup and reports measured counts for loaded memory, skills, rules, and tool schemas.
       Flags: 3 heavy agents, 14 MCP servers (3 CLI-replaceable)
       Top saving: remove 3 MCP servers → -27,500 tokens (47% overhead reduction)
```

**Verbose mode**
```
User: /context-budget --verbose
Skill: Full report + per-file breakdown showing planner.md (213 lines, 1,840 tokens),
       MCP tool list with per-tool sizes, duplicated rule lines side by side
```

**Pre-expansion check**
```
User: I want to add 5 more MCP servers, do I have room?
Skill: Current overhead 33% → adding 5 servers (~50 tools) would add ~25,000 tokens → pushes to 45% overhead
       Recommendation: remove 2 CLI-replaceable servers first to stay under 40%
```

## Best Practices

- **Token estimation**: use `words × 1.3` for prose, `chars / 4` for code-heavy files
- **MCP is the biggest lever**: each tool schema costs ~500 tokens; a 30-tool server costs more than all your skills combined
- **Verify loading behavior**: do not count dormant files unless the runtime actually injects them
- **Verbose mode for debugging**: use when you need to pinpoint the exact files driving overhead, not for regular audits
- **Audit after changes**: run after adding any agent, skill, or MCP server to catch creep early
